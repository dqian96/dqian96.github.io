The University of Waterloo is reputed for several things. People often celebrate the school's
intensive co-op program and academic rigor. The break-neck pace of consecutively alternating
back-and-forth from heavy study terms to internship terms affords very little in-between, sometimes
less than a week. This structure can be prohibitive to students wanting to take time off to travel,
but certainly not impossible. For me, I found it hard to find time to take extended away school. As
my education marched towards its close, I found myself with time on my hands that I didn't know what
to do with. Many of my friends decided to take a grad-trip, a classic coming-of-age experience that
is often mirred with 'finding oneself', binge drinking, and partying. A quick Google search of 
'grad trip' exposes dozens of agencies advertising exotic destinations, culture, and adventure. Our
culture glorifies and commercializes travel and experiences much like our Amazon Prime Day, Black
Friday, or Boxing Day. Can you imagine a company inventing a pseudo-holiday to sell its slew of cheaply
produced goods that will manafactured, packaged, shipped, used, opened, used, and disposed once?
Despite my initially cynical view of traveling, it's...

where, what how?

Having never traveled without my family, I was pretty anxious taking an extended sabbatical to
far-away countries and living in hostels. A small part of the fear stemmed from physical danger, a
moderate part stemmed from losing important documents or missing connections, and the majority was
due to not having a fulfilling trip. When solo-traveling, you are the master of your own time and
actions. If you're lazy/timid, you could seek refuge in the hedonistic pleasures of the Internet. 

I did extensive research on my trip. First I decided the budget, destination, and length of stay.
From my internship savings, I was prepared to spend $3000 USD. Having been surrounded by a plethora
of Asian culture in my upbringing, I decided to choose Europe as my destination. After reading about
possible in rural areas, pickpockets, and the scarcity of English, I decided against Eastern Europe.
Western Europe didn't seem rugged enough for backpacking. Thus, I chose a happy medium in Central
Europe, interested in both the history, culture, and architectural beauty that some of its cities
had to offer. I felt that 3 weeks would be ample time to enjoy my trip, without hitting that wall of
tiredness and loneliness that may come with solo-travel. The rest of my preparation was
straightforward. I read articles on vaccinations, packing lists, Visas, travel between cities,
accomodations, food, money, flights, insurance, and attractions in each city. In choosing hostels, I
wanted to a sample a variety of different types. I tried large, chain hostels, hostels known for its
parties, and small, family-run homestays. In destinations, I alternated between big cities and small
towns to get a variety of experiences, and to also allow a breather from city nightlife.


    




### Why self-reflect?

In the summer of 2015, I read _Steve Jobs_, a fantastic biography by Walter Issacson. I read the book during a time of
my life when I was feeling lost and unsure, and learning about another person's life taught me a lot about how I wanted
to live my own. I was inspired by Jobs' passion and I adopted the idea that one should live working hard on what he/she
loved. My greatest fear, I realized, was _feeling regret on my deathbed_. The feeling of not living up to your
potential, of simply coasting through life without any meaningful destination, of accomplishing little and impacting few
was in my eyes, a tragedy.

After I finished Jobs' biography, I set out on some soul-searching. I began noting down things that I wanted to
accomplish in life. These goals ranged from big and vague to small and specific. For example, one of my goals was to
"leave a footprint on the world" whereas another one was to intern at a big tech company, such as Google, Facebook, etc.
Being fueled by hype, it was easy to maintain focus and work towards these goals for the first little while. Then, when
the excitement wore off and the dust settled, I started getting thoughts that were all too familiar.<sup>1</sup>

> "I'm going to do it tomorrow."

> "I'm tired/sleepy/hungry/etc."

> "Just one more League game..."

I came to the daunting realization that slowly but surely, each day would be met with waning desire to pursue my
aspirations. In a blink of an eye, a year would have passed and I would be once again staring at an empty document
trying to draft my goals, only for them to be orphaned soon after. Procrastination, self-indulgence, and straying away
from the intended path are major precursors to disappointment and unfulfillment, and why success is so difficult to
achieve.

Jobs practiced a simple but effective self-reflection habit in order keep him heading in the right direction. In this
own words:

> "If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?  If the Answer is 'no' for too
> many days in a row, I know I need to change something."

A conscious, persistent, relatively low-effort self-reflection habit is tantamount in preventing the erosion of our
aspirations. It gives us a periodic reminder of our ambitions, enables us to track our progress and ultimately improves
our velocity.

The effectiveness of self-reflection depends on how it's implemented. I believe that self-reflection is most effective
when there is a set of clear objectives underpinning it. Large goals should be broken down into varying granularities
suitable for a given time period. This enables us to evaluate our actions against a rubric at particular time intervals.
Furthermore, personal weaknesses or sources of malcontent should be identified so that actionable next steps can be
taken to remedy the problem. For example, if I notice that my failure rate for technical interviews is less than
reasonable, then perhaps I can improve by doing 1-2 Leetcode questions before I sleep every night.

By practicing self-reflection, it becomes easier to maintain focus on our dreams, hopefully leading to a greater sense
of accomplishment of fufillment later in life.

### How I do self-reflection

At the start of every year, I draft a list of macro goals that I want to achieve. These objectives are usually general
and overarching, such as "live healthily". I break these objectives into smaller, actionable, quantifiable items for
each month, such as "go rock climbing 8 times in January". For each day, I create a list of micro tasks. These tasks
have binary outcomes, for e.g. "go rock climbing for an hour at 7 PM". At the end of every day, month, and year I would
look back on my goals and reflect on my progress, strengths, weaknesses, and next steps for improvement.

I dedicate 5 minutes every morning to review my tasks for the day and 20 minutes every night to reflect and
make plans for tomorrow. I try to keep my reflections concise so that the amount of effort required
is low and it becomes easier to habituate.

I've been practicing self-reflection for a year or so, albeit my commitment to it waxes and wanes from week to week.
Conveniently, this situation sets up an A/B test which reveals that I self-indulge less, manage my todo list better, and
get more work done when I actively self-reflect. Looking back, it's clear that practicing self-reflection has helped
stabilize my life and made it easier than ever for me to work towards my goals.

##### Footnotes

1. Self-indulgence isn't a fundamental evil. It's depends on both extent and timing. It can promote relaxation and
   relive stress after a long day of work or it can be addictive, taking attention away from important responsibilities.
