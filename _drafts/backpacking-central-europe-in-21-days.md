In my 5 year tenure at the University of Waterloo, I never found the opportunity to travel. The
breakneck pace of study and internship terms afforded sometimes as little as a week in between
semesters. In conjunction with my relatively restrictive schooling conditions, my priorities were on
academics and career, rather than leisure. Thus, as I approached graduation, I found myself left
with both an abundance of time and a foreign appetite for respite. Like most of my peers, I decided
to spend my sabbatical on the iconic, coming-of-age adventure known as the _grad trip_. I mean,
you can only "discover yourself" so much when you're coding 5 hours a day.

At 22 years old, I had never traveled more than a couple of days before. Most of the destinations I
visited were close in either proximity or culture and all my travel colleagues were family or close
friends. In other words, there was no sense of challenge and adventure. _Everything was too
comfortable_. Exchange your local cafe for an esoteric restaurant with a name you can't pronounce,
cars for horses, and skyscrapers for mountains and you still would feel at home if you're spending
time with the same people, talking about the same things, and learning barely anything new. To that
end, I decided to solo-backpack Central Europe. Solo-backpacking encourages you to meet new people
(for e.x. through hostels) and empowers you with the freedom to challenge yourself with foreign
activities that might offend the sensibilities of potential travel buddies. Of course, great power
comes with great responsibility - the onus is wholly on you to have you a trip that you'll remember
fondly. I chose Central Europe for it had just enough "grittiness" for backpacking, was foreign but
not overly so, and was the hotbed for major historical events in the 20th century, which I was
interested in.

### Planning

I surmise that an ideal trip treads the tightrope between spontaneity and planning. Enough
spontaneity to nurture a sense of adventure and enough planning so that shit doesn't hit the fan.  I
read a ton of travel blogs and, of course, Reddit, to learn about travel insurance, vaccines,
hostels, plane tickets, attractions, intercity travel, Visas, packing lists, food, money, phone plan
etc. To determine my route, I labeled cities as primary (red) and secondary (blue). Then, I drew a
route that captured as many primary cities as possible. I kept secondary cities that were on the
route and erased the rest. The final result is shown below. Yeah, so I'm a CS major, if this route
optimization algorithm didn't tip you off. I noted some potential attractions to visit in each city,
but didn't plan any further in order to maintain spontaneity and allow flexibility. I don't end up
following my plans when they're too specific anyway.

Berlin was the first destination of my trip. Jet-lagged, hungry, tired, and Internet-less, I
stumbled around looking for a phone plan. The first two Vodafone stores I visited were out of
prepaid SIMs - horrible luck. I lugged my 20 lb backpack through Berlin for 2 hours so that I can
have my faithful companion, Google, in my back pocket once more. The sweltering summer heat and my
debilitating fatigue reminded me of the Greek titan Atlas, punished with the burden of bearing the
weight of the Earth on his back for all eternity. On any other day, I would've collapsed. However,
mesmerized by the originality and beauty of Berlin, I forced myself to keep going. At the end of my
scenic route, I arrived at the
<a href="https://www.hostelworld.com/hosteldetails.php/Wombats-City-Hostel-Berlin/Berlin/22933">
wombat City Hostel </a>. Deprived from sleep for nearly 36 hours, I decided to tuck in early.

Berlin is one of the most historically significant cities in the 20th century. It's even readily
apparent from the architecture. The buildings from the Third Reich are monumentalist - simple,
uniform, and elevated function over form. East Berlin highlights the brutalist architecture of the
Soviets - bleak, concrete, and square, whereas West Berlin embraces a more modern style - emphasis
on form and use of large, open spaces. Despite bolstering a hefty population of 3.5 million, I
rarely felt "cramped". Roads are wide, with lanes reserved for pedestrians, bikes, and vehicles
throughout most of the city. Every few blocks, you'll come across large clearings for a monument,
park, or simply a grassy field. I've never enjoyed being in a city as much as Berlin.

To learn about the history of Berlin, I signed up for a intimate coffee talk with several locals, <a
href="https://www.airbnb.com/experiences/118557">Valerie and Regina</a>, in which I learned a lot
about the checkered history of Berlin from people who actually lived and experienced both sides of
the wall. I learned that while the West experienced tremendous economic growth and social freedoms
orchestrated by Western powers, the East suffered through poverty and intense government scrutiny
and surveillance. Despite the many luxuries that capitalism was able to provide, Valerie and Regina
mentioned that it might have come at a cost. There is a dichotomy in core values between East and
Western Berliners. The people of the East deeply valued family and community whereas the people of
the West worked hard for economic prosperity. It's clear that people cannot be happy without some
fundamental needs such as safety and food, but to what effect does emphasizing individualism and
economic success have on our happiness? Human have been heavily communal for much, much longer
after all.

After 3 days in Berlin, I left for Dresden. Dresden is one of the most beautiful cities I've ever
been to. In the Old Town, you'll come across innumerable churches, monuments, and museums
demonstrating architecture from the Baroque and Renaissance periods. In the New Town, you'll find a
very modern selection of stores, restaurants, and bars. I stayed at <a
href="https://www.lollishome.de/en/">Lolli's Homestay</a>, a very small and family managed hostel,
for 2 nights. At night, I went out with some other hostelers to drink. We brought our own beers
and sat on a curb in street laced with bars. Tons of locals and travelers were huddled in groups on
the street, singing, smoking, chitchatting, and of course, drinking. The hostelers had very diverse
backgrounds; one was a PhD student in psychology, another was a French Canadian studying in Germany,
one was a musician, the other a mechanical engineer - the list goes on. But what unified this
tapestry of cultures, backgrounds, and races was open-mindedness and a love for traveling and
adventure.

An hour train ride from Dresden, you can find the national park Saxon Switerzland. This gorgeous
park is filled with rocky canyons and straddles both Germany and the Czech
Republic. I entered the park from the small town of Königstein and hiked the Lilienstein route in
about 4 hours. At the apex of the hike, I was rewarded with a beautiful view of the small town.

### Czech Republic

Prague. A city famously touted for its history, beauty, and nightlife. In old town Prague, tall,
colorful buildings were packed closely next to each other, often leaving a narrow, wounding road. The
height of the buildings allowed sunlight to bathe the neatly maintained cobblestone roads only at
the noon of day. Roads twisted and turned like a maze with gothic buildings instead of hedges. The
different paths converged to the Old Town Square - a grand clearing that immaculately contrasts the
claustrophobic mood of the roads that led up to it. In the clearing, you could find a mix between
the archaic and modern - churches and soldiers armed with assault riffles, waves and waves of
tourists and aged monuments. At midnight, the tourists begin to thin out, leaving groups of young
people sitting in small circles drinking and laughing under the warm hue of the streetlights. In
other words, Prague is beautiful.

On the first night of my stay, I participated in a bar crawl hosted on Airbnb Experiences. I played
drinking games with people from all over the world - Korea, Austria, Canada, Americans (San
Francisco to be exact - small world eh?).

I did extensive research on my trip. First I decided the budget, destination, and length of stay.
From my internship savings, I was prepared to spend $3000 USD. Having been surrounded by a plethora
of Asian culture in my upbringing, I decided to choose Europe as my destination. After reading about
possible in rural areas, pickpockets, and the scarcity of English, I decided against Eastern Europe.
Western Europe didn't seem rugged enough for backpacking. Thus, I chose a happy medium in Central
Europe, interested in both the history, culture, and architectural beauty that some of its cities
had to offer. I felt that 3 weeks would be ample time to enjoy my trip, without hitting that wall of
tiredness and loneliness that may come with solo-travel. The rest of my preparation was
straightforward. I read articles on vaccinations, packing lists, Visas, travel between cities,
accomodations, food, money, flights, insurance, and attractions in each city. In choosing hostels, I
wanted to a sample a variety of different types. I tried large, chain hostels, hostels known for its
parties, and small, family-run homestays. In destinations, I alternated between big cities and small
towns to get a variety of experiences, and to also allow a breather from city nightlife.

Having never traveled by myself before, I decided to plan my trip very meticulously. I first
determined the budget, destination, and length of stay. From my internship savings, I decided to set
a target of $3000 USD, including airfare. In choosing the destination, I aimed for
originality, safety, and interest. For these reasons, I chose Central Europe as it was satsifiably
foreign, safe, and was astoundingly beautiful and was deeply relevant in recent history. I outlined
major and minor destinations in Central Europe and drew a route connecting the major destinations,
with a few stops at minor destinations along the way (route is shown below). I tried to alternate
between major cities and small towns along my route to prevent myself from burning out. After looking at the
cost of living/travel in these cities, I decided that I could travel for approximately 21 days. The
rest of the research mostly consisted of logistics such as insurance, vaccinations, train/bus/plane
tickets, money, packing lists, hostels, and looking up popular attractions. As I was solo-traveling, I felt
that it was paramount that I stayed in hostels so that I could meet new people and learn about
attractions. I decided only to pinpoint some popular attractions instead of rigorously planning my
day-to-day activities in order to maintain spontaneity and freedom. In retrospect, I did do A LOT of
research, but I ended up being very prepared - i.e. where to draw cash, ear plugs/eye covers,
staying at compatible hostels, how much to back/what to bring, etc.

looking at the cost of living/travel in








Senior trip. It's an iconic coming-of-age phenomenon in the Western world. Most of my friends


The past 5 years of my years was filled with studying, interviewing, moving, and working. Between
school and work terms, sometimes I'm left with only less than a week of break in between. And so,
as my undergraduate career reached its conclusion, I suddenly myself afforded with an uncanny amount
of time on my hands. Finally, the time would be wholly mine and I could choose whatever I wanted to
do with it.


The University of Waterloo is reputed for several things. People often celebrate the school's
intensive co-op program and academic rigor. The break-neck pace of consecutively alternating
back-and-forth from heavy study terms to internship terms affords very little in-between, sometimes
less than a week. This structure can be prohibitive to students wanting to take time off to travel,
but certainly not impossible. For me, I personally found it hard to find time to take extended away
school.As my education marched towards its close, I found myself with time on my hands that I didn't
know what to do with. Many of my friends decided to take a grad-trip, a classic coming-of-age
experience that is often mirred with 'finding oneself', binge drinking, and partying. A quick Google
search of 'grad trip' exposes dozens of agencies advertising exotic destinations, culture, and
adventure. Our culture glorifies and commercializes travel and experiences much like our Amazon
Prime Day, Black Friday, or Boxing Day. Can you imagine a company inventing a pseudo-holiday to sell
its slew of cheaply produced goods that will manafactured, packaged, shipped, used, opened, used,
and disposed once?  Despite my initially cynical view of traveling, it's...

Having never traveled without my family, I was pretty anxious taking an extended sabbatical to
far-away countries and living in hostels. A small part of the fear stemmed from physical danger, a
moderate part stemmed from losing important documents or missing connections, and the majority was
due to not having a fulfilling trip. When solo-traveling, you are the master of your own time and
actions. If you're lazy/timid, you could seek refuge in the hedonistic pleasures of the Internet.
