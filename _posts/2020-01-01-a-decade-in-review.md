In the midst of writing my resolutions for 2020, it dawned on me that the past decade cleanly
delineates an important transitional period in my life. At the beginning of the decade, I was an
naive teenager entering high school. And at its end, I graduated from university and began
building my career as a well-adjusted young adult.

This post is an amalgamation of my thoughts on the past, present, and future. It briefly covers
significant moments in my coming of age, the lessons that I learned as I started
building my career, and my hopes for the future.

# 10 years

### High School

My earliest recollection of this decade was of one breezy autumn morning. A horde of teenagers
congregated in front of an unassuming looking building. The building was decorated with very few
windows, and was 2-storied and spread out over a large area; it's design signaling a style of
architecture from years long past.  Its faded orange bricks contrasted with the bold, blue letters
that labeled the entrance to the school.

A cacophony of voices filled the crisp, autumn air; profanity, foreign languages, teenage slang
inter-mingled together indiscernibly. Some students were accompanied by their parents, some have
already gathered into amicable groups, and some were alone, cautiously observing the foreign
environment that they now found themselves in.  As I stood by myself in this completely new setting,
I was both anxious and excited about how the next 4 years would unfold.

I attended Glenforest Secondary School. It was distant, far from the district that I grew
up in. My parents and I chose this institution because I scored well in middle school and was
accepted into its IB program, which was well-recognized and respected for producing talented alumni.

I was (and still am) a shy person. I had few friends in my freshmen and sophomere year because none
of my friends from primary education attended the school, and I was too shy to start conversations
with strangers. I filled my time with an unhealthy amount of anime and Starcraft II. My day-to-day
consisted of 5-6 hours of gaming and anime, 2-3 hours of school work, and 4-5 hours of sleep.
It was an unhealthy and unsustainable lifestyle that self-perpetuated discontentment.

In my junior and senior year, I started playing League of Legends. It was a very popular game among
some of the guys in my year, who eventually invited me to their games after. Under the backdrop of
banter and flame, we crafted a tight bond that still remains strong to this day. Some friendships
fade with time; some deepen. For the relationships forged in the fire and brimstone of the hell that
was League of Legends, I have confidence that they will only strengthen in the next decade, despite
me being further geographically apart.

As high school drew to a close, I put more effort into my studies. For most of high school, I was a
mid 80's student - very middle of the pack. In the last few months, I put more effort into my
studies graduated near the top of my class and was admitted to the University of Waterloo's
prestigious Software Engineering program.

### University

The University of Waterloo is Canada's feeder school to top Silicon Valley firms. It combines
rigorous academic courses with alternating trimesters of internships. It is expected that at the end
of the 5 year program, students would graduate having completed 6 internships. As a result, the
school perpetuated a culture where self-worth is tied to academic or professional success.
Unforgiving, competitive, and brilliant describes both the school and its students.

Both the academic and professional pressures took a toll on my physical and mental health. My first
3 interview seasons were filled with hundreds of application rejections, and dozens of interview
failures. I didn't have a strong CS background coming into college as my high school didn't offer CS
classes. The sheer load of academic courses was difficult to handle due to poor studying strategies.

I started adjusting better in my 3rd year. After taking algorithms and practicing over 200 Leetcode
questions, I started performing well in interviews. My seniority as a student was able to nab me
interview with top firms and my newly acquired CS knowledge empowered me to pass most of the
interviews I was selected for. I ended up having 3 fulfilling internships at Salesforce, Facebook,
and Airbnb in Silicon Valley.

### Graduation and Work (2019)

The day I graduated was similar to my first day of high school. It was a warm day
in June, and students were dressed in celebratory robes, accompanied by both parents and friends.
A cacophony of voices filled the air, except this time, devoid of profanity and teenage slang.
This time, however, I was no longer alone. I was surrounded by my loving family, old high school
friends, and the new friends I made in university.

2019 was an eventful year and the de facto climax to the past decade.
Here are some of the most memorable moments, in chronological order:
* I survived CS480 taught by Yaoliang Yu (never take that class with him)
* I built a Java compiler with my friends and had a great time doing so
* I graduated from university with Distinction
* I visited China for the first time in 5 years and reconnected with my extended family.
  I witnessed the beauty of Hangzhou/Suzhou and was blown away by the grandiosity and modernity of
  Shanghai
* I solo-backpacked Central Europe in 21 days and connected with people from different parts of the
  world
* I started my full-time job at Facebook
* I started playing guitar
* I hit my powerlifting goals and achieved 2 plate bench, 3 plate squat, and 4 plate deadlift at
  145 lbs
* I read 13 books - the most I've ever read in a year
* I had a hell of time hanging out with my friends during Christmas holidays

 I couldn't have asked for a better year to conclude the last decade.

# On time, or lack thereof

The seemingly swift passage of the preceding decade is haunting. I realized that resources, such as
time and energy are limited. The finitude of resources and abilities allows one to frame life as a
resource allocation problem. It's impossible to achieve everything and there are trade-offs made
with every decision. This begs the question - how should one allocate their resources so that they
can live a life with the most value?

Some pursuits are principled on immediate gratification. For example, casually playing games or
having a fun night out with friends. Reasons for this class of pursuits may include relaxation,
happiness, or building memories.

Some goals are long-term in nature. The value of these undertakings accumulate over time - for
example, endeavors such as studying, exercising, or working. Often, these goals not only take
hard-work and commitment over long stretches of time, but may also require keen interest in the
pursuit itself. As such, these goals are difficult, but are incredibly satisfying when finally
achieved. Because of the time commitment, every minute that these goals are delayed, the longer it
takes for the allegorical tree to bear fruit.

However one decides to expend their resources, there is always an opportunity cost. In a parallel
universe, a different choice was made, and a contrasting result was obtained. Moreover, different
choices constrain you to a particular set of subsequent actions (i.e. the butterfly effect). And so,
like a chain of dominoes, each and every choice invariably affects the next set of available
options, inevitably leading one to a particular end. There are no checkpoints, no second chances,
and no undo's in life.

In the past decade, a path was laid out for me. "Do well in school, get good internships, and secure
a solid paying full-time job". I didn't have to think much about how to allocate my time because I
only considered the paved path in front of me. The way forward now is much more unclear than the
one laid out 10 years ago. There is now greater opportunity to build a life that I value
most. However, that also means that the responsibility is mine alone, for making both the right, and
_wrong_ choices. This makes me a bit anxious, just to say the least.

During the waning months of 2019, I realized that work takes up a large portion of my time. It
became painfully clear that I could not pursue all that which I wanted. And so, I began fervently
tracking my time using <a

</a>. I want to use the data I collect from this app to optimize how I allocate my time.

### Plans for the next Decade

Prospectively, 10 years is a lot of time. I'm still contemplating what I want to
spend my time on. However, here are some goals I'm currently considering:

* career -> I want to be promoted to a senior engineer in 3 years and join
  a startup after
* athletics -> I want to win a regional powerlifting competition
* learning -> I want to read 300 books in the next decade
* travel -> I want to backpack a different part of the world every year (some leeway here)
* music -> I want to become as good in guitar as I am in piano (level 9)
* friends -> I want to deepen my existing friendships and build new ones
* passion projects -> I want to build apps, websites, or services and have a consistent stream of
  side revenue

### 2020

A daunting project is made far less intimidating through a piecemeal breakdown. And so, here are
smaller, quantifiable goals for next year. I included percentage time estimates to help me
stay on track and prevent competing projects from "stealing resources".

* career -> I want to be promoted to E4 in one or two halves (40%)
* athletics -> I want to compete in my first PL competition and have a total of 1100 (10%)
* learning -> I want to read 30 books in 2020 (10%)
* travel -> I want to spend 21 days backpacking western Europe in the summer (10%)
* music -> I want to play <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_31xKFzSy4">this</a> (10%)
* friends -> I want to join a class/sports team and meet all my close friends at least a few times
  a year (10%)
* passion projects -> create a very simple app/website and publish it (5%)

# Happy New Year

If you got to the end of this post, thank you for your attention and interest. I wish you nothing
but the best for the new year and the decade to come!
