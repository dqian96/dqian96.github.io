In the midst of writing resolutions for 2020, it dawned on me that the past decade cleanly
delineates an important transitional period in my life. At the start of the decade, I was an naive
teenager entering high school. And at its termination, I graduated from university and began
building my career as a young adult.

This post is an amalgamation of my thoughts on the past, present, future. It briefly covers
significant moments in the last 10 years and in 2019, the lessons that I learned as I started
full-time, and my hopes for the future.

# 10 years

### High School

My earliest memory of this decade was of one breezy autumn morning.  A horde of teenagers
congregated in front of an unimpressive looking building. The building was decorated with very few
windows, and was 2-storied and spread out over a large area; it's design signaling its advanced
age. Its faded orange bricks contrasted with the bold, blue letters that labeled the entrance to the
school.

A cacophony of voices filled the crisp, autumn air; profanity, foreign languages, teenage slang
inter-mingled together indiscernibly. Some teenagers were accompanied by their parents, some have
already gathered into amicable groups, and some were alone, cautiously observing the foreign that
they now found themselves in.  As I stood by myself in this completely foreign setting, I was
anxious and excited about how the next 4 years would turn out. What kinds of friends will I make?
And what kind of person will I mature in?

I attended Glenforest Secondary School. It was distant, far from the district that I grew
up in. My parents and I chose this institution because I scored well in middle school and was
accepted into its IB program, which was well-recognized and respected for producing talented alumni.

I was (and still am) a shy person. I had few friends in my freshmen and sophomere year because none
of my friends from primary education attended the school and I was too shy to meet new
people. I filled my time with an unhealthy amount of anime and Starcraft II. My day-to-day consisted
of 5-6 hours of Starcraft II and anime, 2-3 hours of school work, and 4-5 hours of sleep. It was an
unhealthy and unsustainable lifestyle.

In my junior and senior year, I started playing League of Legends. It was a very popular game among
some of the guys in my year. Upon learning that I also enjoyed the game, they invited me to play
with them. Under the backdrop of banter, flame, and insults, we forged a tight bond that still
remains strong to this day. Some friendships fade with time; some deepen. For the ones forged in the
fire and brimstone of the hell that was League of Legends, I have the utmost confidence that those
friendships will only strengthen in the next decade, despite being further geographically apart.

As high school drew to a close, I put more effort into my studies. For most of high school, I was a
mid 80's student - very middle of the pack. My effort was evidently not misplaced as I ended up
graduating near the top of my class and was admitted to the University of Waterloo's prestigious
Software Engineering program.

### University

The University of Waterloo is Canada's feeder school to top Silicon Valley firms. It combines
rigorous academic courses with alternating trimesters of internships. It is expected that at the end
of the 5 year program, students would graduate having completed 6 internships. As a result, the
school self-perpetuated a culture where self-worth is tied to academic or professional success.
Unforgiving, competitive, and brilliant describes both the school and its students.

Both the academic and professional pressures took a toll on my health and happiness. My first 3
interview seasons were filled with hundreds of application rejections, and dozens of interview
failures. I didn't have a strong CS background coming into college as my high school did not offer
CS classes. The sheer load of academic courses was difficult to handle due to inefficient studying
strategies. My typical grades and subpar interview performance translated to physical and mental
health deterioration.

I started adjusting better in my 3rd year. After taking algorithms and practicing over 200 Leetcode
questions, I started performing well in interviews. My seniority as a student was able to nab me
interview with top firms and my newly acquired CS knowledge empowered me to pass most of the
interviews I was selected for. I ended up having 3 fulfilling internships at Salesforce, Facebook,
and Airbnb in the Bay Area.

My academic success from high school never really carried over to University. I ended up graduating
in the upper half of my class, but not much more than that.

# 2019

The day I graduated was similar to my first day of high school in several ways. It was a warm day
in June, and students were dressed in celebratory robes, accompanied by both parents and friends.
A cacophony of voices filled the air, except this time, devoid of profanity and teenage slang.

2019 was an eventful year and felt like an appropriate end to the transitional period that was the
previous decade. Here are some of the most memorable moments:
* I survived CS480 taught by Yaoliang Yu
* I built a Java compiler with my friends and had a great time doing so
* I graduated from University with Distinction
* I read 13 books - the most I've ever read in a year
* I visited China for the first time in 5 years and reconnected with my family. I saw the beauty of
  Hanzhou/Suzhou and was blown away by the gradiosity and modernity of Shanghai
* I solo-backpacked Central Europe in 21 days and connected with people from different parts of the
  world
* I started playing guitar
* I started my full-time job at Facebook
* I hit my powerlifting goals and achieved 2 plate bench, 3 plate squat, and 4 plate deadlift at
  145 lbs
* I had a hell of time hanging out with my friends during Christmas holidays

 I couldn't have asked for a better year to conclude the last decade.

# On time, or lack thereof

The seemingly swift passage of the preceding decade is haunting. It dawned on me that resources,
such as time and energy are limited. The finitude of our resources allows us to view life as a
resource allocation problem. It's impossible to achieve everything and there are trade-offs made
with every decision. This begs the question - how should we allocate our resources so we can live
a life with the most value?

Some pursuits are principled on immediate gratification. For example, casually playing games or
having a fun night out with friends. Reasons for this class of pursuits may include relaxation,
happiness, or building memories.

Some goals are long-term in nature. The value of these undertakings grow over time - for example,
endeavors such as studying, exercising, or working. Often, these goals not only take hard-work and
commitment over long stretches of time, but may also require keen interest in the pursuit itself.
For those reasons, these goals are difficult to achieve, but are incredibly satisfying when finally
achieved. Because of the time commitment, every minute that these goals are pushed-off, the longer it
takes for the allegorical tree to bear fruit.

However one decides to expend their resources, there is always an opportunity cost. In a parallel
universe, a different choice was made, and a contrasting result may be obtained. Moreover, different
choices constrain you to a particular set of subsequent actions (i.e. the butterfly effect). And so,
like a chain of dominoes, each and every choice invariably affects the next set of available
options, inevitably leading you to one particular end. There are no checkpoints, no second chances,
and no undos.

In the past decade, a path was laid out for me. "Do well in school, get good internships, and secure
a solid paying full-time job". I didn't have to think much about how to allocate my time because I
only considered the path handed to me. The path forward now is much more ambiguous than the one laid
out for me 10 years ago. There is now a greater opportunity to build the life that I value most, but
the paradox of choice induces a great deal of anxiety.

During the waning months of 2019, I realized that work takes up a large portion of my time. It
became painfully clear that I could not pursue all that which I wanted. And so, I began feverntly
tracking my time using <a

</a>. I want to use the data I collect from this app to optimize how I allocate my time.

### Plans for the next Decade

Prospectively, 10 years is a lot of time. I'm still in the process of determining what I want to
spend my time on. However, here are some goals I'm currently considering:

* career -> I want to be promoted to a senior engineer in 3 years and join
  a startup after
* athletics -> I want to win a regional powerlifting competition
* learning -> I want to read 300 books in the next decade
* travel -> I want to backpack a different part of the world every year (some leeway here)
* music -> I want to become as good in guitar as I am in piano (level 9)
* friends -> I want to deepen my existing friendships and build new ones
* passion projects -> I want to build apps, websites, or services and have a consistent stream of
  side revenue

### 2020

A daunting project is made far less intimidating through a piecemeal breakdown. And so, here are
smaller, quantifiable goals for next year. I included percentage time estimates which would aid me
to stay on track and prevent me from "stealing resources" from competing projects.

* career -> I want to be promoted to E4 in one or two halves (40%)
* athletics -> I want to compete in my first PL competition and have a total of 1100 (15%)
* learning -> I want to read 30 books in 2020 (10%)
* travel -> I want to spend 21 days backpacking western Europe in the summer (10%)
* music -> I want to play <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_31xKFzSy4">this</a> (10%)
* friends -> I want to join a class/sports team and meet all my close friends at least a few times
  a year (10%)
* passion projects -> create a very simple app/website and publish it (5%)

During 2020, I will try to stay on track by reviewing my time estimates using the help of Boosted.
At the end of 2020, I will review whether or not these goals were achieved and what could be done
better.

# Happy New Year

If you got to the end of this post, thank you for your attention and interest. I wish you nothing
but the best for the new year and the decade to come!
