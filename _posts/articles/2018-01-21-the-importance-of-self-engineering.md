In the summer of 2015, I read _Steve Jobs_, a fantastic biography by Walter Issacson. I read the book during a time of
my life when I was feeling lost and unsure, and learning about another person's life taught me a lot about how I wanted
to lead my own. I was inspired by Jobs' passion and I latched on to the idea that one should live working on what he/she
loved. My greatest fear, I realized, was _feeling regret on my deathbed_. The feeling of not living up to your
potential, of simply coasting through life without any meaningful destination, of accomplishing little and impacting few
was in my eyes, a tragedy.

Following this realization, I began noting down the things that I wanted to accomplish. These goals ranged from
big and vague to small and specific. For example, one of goals was to "leave a footprint" on the world whereas another
one was intern at a big tech company, such as Google, Facebook, etc. It was easy to get caught up in the hype and I
breezed through the first few days of work. Then, when the excitement wore off and the dust settled, I started
getting thoughts that were all too familiar:

> "I'm going to do it tomorrow."

> "I'm tired/sleepy/hungry/etc."

> "Just one more league game..."

Slowly but surely, each day would be met with waning desire to pursue your goals. In a blink of an eye, an year
would have passed and you would be staring at an empty document trying to once again draft your goals, only for them
to be abandoned soon after. I believe this is why success is so difficult to achieve.
 
Jobs practiced a simple but effective self-reflection habit in order keep him heading in the right direction.
In this own words:

> "If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?
> If the Answer is 'no' for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something."

The idea of a conscious, persistent, relatively low-effort review is tantamount in preventing the erosion of goals.


> Self-engineering is the set of ideas, processes, and actions for the identification, assessment, and change of personal
> strengths and weaknesses.

[1] I'm not saying that immediate gratifications are bad. It depends on the extent and whether or not you view it as
a toxin to your goals
