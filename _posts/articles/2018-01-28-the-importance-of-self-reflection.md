### Why self-reflect?

In the summer of 2015, I read _Steve Jobs_, a fantastic biography by Walter Issacson. I read the book during a time of
my life when I was feeling lost and unsure, and learning about another person's life taught me a lot about how I wanted
to live my own. I was inspired by Jobs' passion and I adopted the idea that one should live working hard on what he/she
loved. My greatest fear, I realized, was _feeling regret on my deathbed_. The feeling of not living up to your
potential, of simply coasting through life without any meaningful destination, of accomplishing little and impacting few
was in my eyes, a tragedy.

Following this realization, I began noting down the things that I wanted to accomplish. These goals ranged from big and
vague to small and specific. For example, one of my goals was to "leave a footprint" on the world whereas another one
was to intern at a big tech company, such as Google, Facebook, etc. It was easy to get caught up in the hype and I
breezed through the first few days of work. Then, when the excitement wore off and the dust settled, I started getting
thoughts that were all too familiar.<sup>1</sup>

> "I'm going to do it tomorrow."

> "I'm tired/sleepy/hungry/etc."

> "Just one more league game..."

I realized that slowly but surely, each day would be met with waning desire to pursue my aspirations. In a blink of an
eye, an year would have passed and I would be staring at an empty document trying to once again draft my goals, only for
them to be abandoned soon after. Procrastination, self-indulgence, and straying away from the path we set out on is a
grand source of disappointment, unfulfillment, and unhappiness. It is also why I believe this is why success is so
difficult to achieve.
 
Jobs practiced a simple but effective self-reflection habit in order keep him heading in the right direction.  In this
own words:

> "If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?  If the Answer is 'no' for too
> many days in a row, I know I need to change something."

The idea of a conscious, persistent, relatively low-effort self-reflection is tantamount in preventing the erosion of
goals.  It gives us a periodic reminder of our ambitions, enables us to track our progress and ultimately improves our
velocity.

The effectiveness of self-reflection depends on how it is implemented. I believe that self-reflection is most effective
when there is a set of clear objectives underpinning it. Large goals should be broken down into varying granularities
suitable for the given time period. This enables us to evaluate our actions against a rubric at particular time
intervals. Furthermore, during self-reflection, one should look at weaknesses or sources of malcontent and strategize
actionable next steps for improvement. For example, if I notice that my failure rate for technical interviews is less
than reasonable, then perhaps I can improve by doing 1-2 Leetcode questions before I sleep every night.

By practicing self-reflection, we can stay the course and achieve our ambitions and feel fufilled. We can learn more
about ourselves and grow.

### How I do self-reflection

At the start of every year, I draft a list of macro goals I want to achieve. These objectives are usually general and
overarching, such as "live healthily". I break these objectives into smaller, actionable, quantifiable items for each
month, such as "go rock climbing 8 times in January". For each day, I create a list of "micro" tasks. These tasks have
binary outcomes, for e.g. "go rock climbing for an hour at 7 PM".  Every day, month, and year I look back on my goals
and I reflect on my progress, strengths, weaknesses, and next steps for improvement.

I dedicate 5 minutes every morning to review my tasks for the day and 20 minutes every night to gather my thoughts
about the day and plan my tasks for tomorrow. I try to keep my reflection concise so that the amount of effort required
is lower and it becomes easier to habitize.

I have been practicing this form of self-reflection for a year or so. Admittely, it has been on and off. I tend to have
long streaks of daily practice and streaks of ignoring it completely.  However, A/B testing reveals that I self-indulge
less, manage my todo list better, and get more work done when I practice self-reflection.  Self-reflection has been an
invaluable technique for me to stabilize my life and prioritize my goals.
