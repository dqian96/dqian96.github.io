My name is David Qian and I am currently a 4th year software engineering student at the University of Waterloo.
I am currently interning as a software engineer on the Data.AI team at Facebook and will be interning
at Airbnb in the summer 2018. Previously, I worked at Salesforce, Blackberry, and SAP.

I lead my life following several principles. I strongly believe that one should be **_true to their word_**. I think
that it's incredibly admirable for people to act on their word. Words without action are shallow and superficial.

I believe that people should live with a **_purpose/dream_** in mind.
Without a destination, it becomes impossible to measure progress and life becomes stagnant.

To achieve a goal, I believe that **_hard work_** and **_self-reflection_** are critical. Tenacity and
persistence are difficult and often cannot be substituted by natural talent or luck. However, hard work without
self-reflection could result in stagnation and inefficiency.
I believe in a self-engineering process where one actively reflects on their own strengths and weaknesses.

Here's a couple of facts about me. Each point isn't deserving enough of a whole paragraph so this seems to be
the most reasonable format of presenting it.

* I was born in Anshan, China and moved to Mississauga, Canada when I was 6
* I was a C student in elementary school
* I am an <a class="short-link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ibo.org/">IB</a> program alumni
* I'm currently learning Vim
* I recently got into weight lifting and am following the 5/3/1 program (1RMs as of Dec 2017: dl - 195, bench - 165,
  squat - 185, OHP - 90)
* I recently discovered rock climbing and I'm loving it!
* I love data - I track how my lifts progress, the number of
  <a class="short-link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">pomodoros</a>
  I do each day, etc.
* I never read much as a child and I'm trying to make up for lost pages now

On this blog, you might find posts on software engineering, computer science, books, food, and life. For example,
some post ideas include: a book review on "How to Win Friends and Influence People" by Dale Carnegie,
implementing Tim Sort for the HPC language Chapel, a restaurant review, etc.
