My name is David Qian and I am currently a 4th year software engineering student at the University of Waterloo.
I am currently interning as a software engineer on the Data.AI team at Facebook and will be interning
at Airbnb in the summer 2018. Previously, I worked at Salesforce, Blackberry, and SAP.

I strive to live with several core values. I strongly believe that one should be **_true to their word_**. I have
nothing but the utmost respect for people who carry out what they say they will do. I believe that people should
live with a **_purpose/dream_** in mind. Without a destination, it becomes impossible to measure progress and life
becomes stagnant. To achieve a goal, I believe that **_hard work_** and **_self-reflection_** are critical. Tenacity and
persistence are difficult and often cannot be substituted by natural talent or luck. However, hard work without
self-reflection could result in stagnation and inefficiency. Active reflection is a self-engineering process
that highlights the strengths and weaknesses of your approach, leading to gains in efficiency.

Here's a couple of facts about me. Each point isn't deserving enough of a whole paragraph so this seems to be
the most reasonable format of presenting it.

* I was born in Anshan, China and moved to Mississauga, Canada when I was 6
* I was a C student in elementary school
* I am an IB program alumni
* I'm currently learning Vim
* I recently got into weight lifting and am following the 5/3/1 program (1RPMs as of Dec 2017: dl - 195, bench - 165,
  squat - 185, OHP - 90)
* I'm a beginner rock climber
* I love data - I track how my lifts progress, the amount of work I do each day, etc.
* I never read much as a child and I am (hugely) regretting this now

On this blog, you might find posts on software engineering, computer science, books, and life. For example, some post
ideas include: a book review on "How to Win Friends and Influence People" by Dale Carnegie, implementing Tim Sort
for the HPC language Chapel, etc.
