Hey there! Nice to meet you, my name is David. Looks like you stumbled on my blog. On here, you'll
find a (admittely, very limited) assortment of my ramblings on life, travel, software development,
and whatever else that I happen to find interesting.

Since you're on this page, I'm assuming you want to know a little more about me. I'm a recent
graduate of the University of Waterloo. I studied software engineering for 5 years there. During
that time, I co-op'd (in reverse chronological order) at Airbnb, Facebook, Salesforce, Blackberry, and
SAP. I'm currently working at Facebook at their headquarters in Menlo Park, California.

I grew up in the suburbs of Toronto with my immigrant family. And just like about every other Asian kid
that I knew, I grew up learning piano, academically studios, and playing lots of video games -
typical right? As I aged, I started to appreciate the importance of _variety_, in experiences,
passions, and relationships. Now, I spend my time pursuing an amalgamation of the following:

* reading
* solo-backpacking
* powerlifting (you can find my workout plans <a class="short-link" target="_blank" href="
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y_kKK-yfKHm2xfnHU9Y34mM-GAIWd6a_m1owIcutHFw/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>)
* learning fingerstyle guitar
* learning to cook
* writing blog entries
* rock climbing
* playing Catan with my friends

Most of the essays on this blog are for my own benefit - they help express and summarize my own
experiences and learnings. However, I do hope you find some of my musings interesting or useful!

<!---
I lead my life following several principles. I strongly believe that one should be **_true to their word_**. I think
that it's incredibly admirable for people to act on their word. Words without action are shallow and superficial.

I believe that people should live with a **_purpose/dream_** in mind.
Without a destination, it becomes impossible to measure progress and life becomes stagnant.

To achieve a goal, I believe that **_hard work_** and **_self-reflection_** are critical. Tenacity and
persistence are difficult and often cannot be substituted by natural talent or luck. However, hard work without
self-reflection could result in stagnation and inefficiency.
I believe in a self-engineering process where one actively reflects on their own strengths and weaknesses.
